This is a lite version of a CLI game inspired by the popular card game *Take 6!* (also known as *6 Nimmt!*). Unlike the original game, this version is designed as a 2-player game, consisting of a user player and a bot player. The gameplay has been simplified to offer a quick and enjoyable experience.
